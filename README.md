## Summary
 On this project you can find how to use:
 
 * state
 * useEfect
 * context
 * components
 * props
 * routing
 * forms
 * and more...

However, this demo project gives you all the core features and a good foundation which you need to dip deeper into React and there hopefully be a bit clearer what React is, how it works and you now should be able to start building your own React projects as well.
